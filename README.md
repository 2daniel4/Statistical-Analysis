# Statistical-Analysis
# These are predominantly R scripts used to summarize and visualize dti region of interest data. 
# As well as perform ttests, Anovas, correlation, linear regression, and mediation analysis.
# Be sure to use the appropriate ttest if the summary information shows that the data does not fit a normal distribution. 
# There is also some code for running tract based spatial statistics and multiple comparison corrections using FSL's randomise function which incorporates cluster thresholding with a monte-carlo simulation
